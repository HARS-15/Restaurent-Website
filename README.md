# Restaurant Website

This project is a fully functional restaurant management web application built using **Django** and **MySQL**. It allows restaurant owners and customers to interact through features like:

- **Dynamic Category and Menu Item Listing**: View items based on categories dynamically loaded using Jinja2 templates.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system for customers to manage their profiles.
- **Order Management**: Customers can place, view, and manage orders.
- **Admin Control**: Restaurant owners can manage items, categories, and track orders via the admin panel.

The project is styled with **HTML** and **CSS** for the frontend, and utilizes Django's ORM for smooth database interactions.
